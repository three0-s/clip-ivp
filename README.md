## Official Implementation of CLIP-IVP.

In this study, we propose a novel method called CLIP-based
Intraoral View Prediction (CLIP-IVP) for predicting novel views of intraoral
structure using only a single front teeth image of a patient. This
task has not been explored in previous medical imaging applications.
Our approach leverages pre-trained CLIP image encoder to represent
front intraoral images, reducing time and resources for training. Our
model achieves a Frâ€€chet Inception Distance (FID) score of 3.4 on the intraoral
view prediction task, suggesting the effectiveness of our method.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that our model can be used to predict
the orthodontic treatment process in a one-shot manner, which might
be useful in treatment planning and prediction. Overall, our proposed
model provides a new framework for generating high-fidelity medical
images and opens up possibilities for future research in this field. Our
work has the potential to provide more accurate predictions only using
a small amount of data, and to support clinicians for better treatment
planning. Additionally, our approach can be adapted for use in
other domains.
